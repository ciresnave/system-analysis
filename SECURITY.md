## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the system-analysis crate, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email us directly at: security@system-analysis-project.org (or create a private issue)
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress every 5 business days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We may provide a CVE number for significant vulnerabilities

## Security Considerations

### Data Handling

The system-analysis crate:

- **Does NOT** transmit any system information over the network by default
- **Does NOT** store sensitive information persistently
- **Does NOT** require elevated privileges to run
- **Does** only read publicly available system information

### Potential Risks

While the crate is designed to be safe, users should be aware of:

1. **System Information Exposure**: The crate reads and exposes detailed system information. Ensure this data is handled appropriately in your application.

2. **Resource Usage**: System analysis operations can be resource-intensive. Consider rate limiting in production applications.

3. **Dependency Security**: We regularly audit our dependencies. Users should also keep dependencies updated.

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate workload requirements and system configurations
2. **Error Handling**: Properly handle all error cases to prevent information leakage
3. **Logging**: Be careful not to log sensitive system information
4. **Access Control**: Implement appropriate access controls around system analysis features

### Dependency Security

We use the following practices to ensure dependency security:

- Regular `cargo audit` runs in CI/CD
- Dependabot alerts for known vulnerabilities
- Minimal dependency tree to reduce attack surface
- Only well-maintained, reputable crates

### Compliance

The system-analysis crate is designed to be compliant with:

- **GDPR**: No personal data is collected or processed
- **SOC 2**: Appropriate security controls for system information handling
- **Common Security Standards**: Following Rust security best practices

## Security Features

### Memory Safety

- Written in Rust for memory safety guarantees
- No unsafe code in the core library
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

### Input Validation

- All public APIs validate input parameters
- Graceful handling of malformed data
- Protection against resource exhaustion attacks

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error types with appropriate detail levels
- No sensitive information leaked through error messages
- Proper error propagation throughout the API

## Reporting Security Issues in Dependencies

If you discover a security issue in one of our dependencies:

1. Report it to the dependency maintainer first
2. If the maintainer is unresponsive, report it to the RustSec Advisory Database
3. Notify us if the vulnerability affects system-analysis functionality

## Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information
- [ ] Proper input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] No unsafe code without proper justification and review
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] New dependencies have been security reviewed
- [ ] Tests include security-relevant edge cases
