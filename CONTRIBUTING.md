# Contributing to System Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the System Analysis crate! This document provides guidelines for contributors.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70.0 or later
- Git
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/system-analysis.git
cd system-analysis
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Running Examples

```bash
cargo run --example basic_analysis
cargo run --example ai_workload_analysis
```

## Code Style and Standards

### Formatting

We use `rustfmt` with default settings:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

### Linting

We use `clippy` for additional linting:

```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

### Documentation

- All public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
- Include examples in doc comments where helpful
- Use `cargo doc --open` to preview documentation

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Place tests in the same file as the code using `#[cfg(test)]`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

### Integration Tests

- Integration tests go in the `tests/` directory
- Test complete workflows and real-world scenarios
- Include edge cases and error conditions

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage. Run tests with:

```bash
cargo test
cargo test --doc  # Run documentation tests
```

## Adding New Features

### 1. Hardware Capabilities

When adding support for new hardware types:

1. Add the hardware type to `src/types.rs`
2. Implement capability analysis in `src/capabilities.rs`
3. Update the system analyzer in `src/analyzer.rs`
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation and examples

### 2. Workload Types

For new workload types:

1. Implement the `Workload` trait in `src/workloads.rs`
2. Define resource requirements
3. Add validation logic
4. Include performance estimation
5. Add tests and examples

### 3. Analysis Features

For new analysis capabilities:

1. Add types to `src/types.rs`
2. Implement logic in appropriate modules
3. Integrate with the main analyzer
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation

## Code Review Process

1. **Create a branch** for your feature/fix
2. **Write tests** before implementing functionality (TDD encouraged)
3. **Implement** your changes following the existing patterns
4. **Run all tests** and ensure they pass
5. **Update documentation** including README if needed
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Use descriptive titles and detailed descriptions
- Reference any related issues
- Include test coverage for new functionality
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature/fix

## Architecture Guidelines

### Error Handling

- Use `thiserror` for error types
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include context where helpful
- Use `Result<T, SystemAnalysisError>` for fallible operations

### Async Patterns

- Use `async/await` for I/O operations
- Avoid blocking operations in async contexts
- Use appropriate timeouts for external operations

### Performance Considerations

- Use `rayon` for CPU-intensive parallel operations
- Cache expensive computations when appropriate
- Be mindful of memory allocation in hot paths
- Use appropriate data structures for the use case

## Module Organization

```
src/
├── lib.rs           # Public API and module declarations
├── analyzer.rs      # Main system analysis logic
├── capabilities.rs  # Hardware capability assessment
├── error.rs         # Error types and handling
├── resources.rs     # Resource management and requirements
├── types.rs         # Core data types
├── utils.rs         # Utility functions and helpers
└── workloads.rs     # Workload definitions and traits
```

## Documentation Standards

### API Documentation

- Use `///` for public API documentation
- Include `# Examples` sections for complex APIs
- Document error conditions with `# Errors`
- Include `# Panics` if the function can panic

### README Updates

When adding features, update:
- Feature list
- Quick start examples
- API overview
- Installation instructions if needed

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Checklist Before Release

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated
- [ ] Version numbers are bumped
- [ ] Examples work correctly
- [ ] Performance benchmarks run

## Getting Help
