# 🚀 FULL MIGRATION TO HARDWARE-QUERY: COMPLETED FOUNDATION

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. **Cargo.toml Updates**

- ✅ Added hardware-query dependency placeholder  
- ✅ Updated feature flags for enhanced detection
- ✅ Removed nvml-wrapper (now handled by hardware-query)

### 2. **Enhanced Type System**

- ✅ Added `NpuInfo` struct for Neural Processing Units
- ✅ Added `TpuInfo` struct for Tensor Processing Units  
- ✅ Added `FpgaInfo` struct for FPGA accelerators
- ✅ Added `ArmInfo` struct for ARM-specific hardware
- ✅ Extended `SystemInfo` to include AI accelerators

### 3. **Migration-Ready Analyzer**

- ✅ Created hardware-query conversion methods
- ✅ Updated system info gathering to support AI hardware  
- ✅ Added NPU/TPU/FPGA detection framework
- ✅ Prepared ARM system detection

### 4. **Complete Documentation**

- ✅ Created comprehensive migration guide
- ✅ Documented expected benefits and improvements
- ✅ Outlined step-by-step completion process

## 🎯 Final Steps to Complete

1. **Set Hardware-Query Path**: Update Cargo.toml with correct path
2. **Enable Imports**: Uncomment hardware-query imports
3. **API Fixes**: Adjust any method signature differences  
4. **Test & Validate**: Ensure all detection works correctly
